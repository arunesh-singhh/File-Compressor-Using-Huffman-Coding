# File-Compressor-Using-Huffman-Coding

What is this project about?

This project is about Building an application for Text File Compression using Huffman Coding. 
Given a text file as an input, this will compress the file and then save the file with reduced size. 
You can also decompress the file using this into its original form. Also you can compress the size of its bit sequence to obtain a binary sequence that has size significantly lesser than the original, this new sequence then can be sent through a network or saved in file so that it can be decompressed whenever required.
